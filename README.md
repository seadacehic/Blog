BlogPost App

Welcome to my little BlogPost app
My app has few methods implemented. You can test the code through swagger. 
When you start the app, you can see the start page as some values ( default page ). After you click on the swagger page, there are some methods implemented you wanted.
I am made my project through controllers, services and interface to make it easier and better.
For the Tags, there is a GET method for becoming all tags ( api/tags ).
For the Posts, there is more methods:
GET - lists all posts filtered ( api/posts )
GET/slug - gives us the post by given slug ( api/posts/slug )
POST -  adds post ( api/posts )
PUT - updates a post ( api/posts/slug )
DELETE - removes a post ( api/posts )

Good luck :)
